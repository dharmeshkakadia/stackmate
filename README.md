# Stackmate - CloudFormation for CloudStack

A library designed to read existing CloudFormation templates 
and execute them on a CloudStack deployment. 
Uses the [ruote](http://ruote.rubyforge.org) workflow engine,
and embeds a modular [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application for wait handles.

Unlike CloudFormation, it does not  run as a web application. 
Instead it runs everything on the client side.

[Stacktician](https://github.com/chiradeep/stacktician) embeds stackmate to run it as a web application.

Note that only Basic Zone (aka EC2-Classic) is supported for now.

## Dependencies

stackmate uses [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to setup and maintain its
environment. Before running stackmate for the first time you need to install
Bundler (gem install bundler) and then run:

```bash
$ bundle install

```

Bundler will download all the required gems and install them for you.

Have a look at the Gemfile if you want to see the various dependencies.

## Getting started quickly

### Using the source

* Get the source files using git

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/chiradeep/stackmate.git
$ cd stackmate
```

* Make sure every dependency is resolved.

```bash
$ bundle install
```
* Find your API key and secret key and the url for CloudStack

For example

```bash
$ export APIKEY=upf7L-tvcHFCSYhKhw-45l9IfaKXNQSWf0nXyWye6eqOBpLT5TqN8XQGeuloV3LbSwD6zuucz22L233Nrqg2pg
$ export SECKEY=9iSsuImdUxU0oumHu0p11li4IoUtwcvrSHcU63ZHS_y-4Iz3w5xPROzyjZTUXkhI9E7dy0r3vejzgCmaQfI-yw
$ export URL="http://localhost:8080/client/api"
```

* The supplied templates are taken from the AWS samples. 

You need a couple of mappings from AWS ids to your CloudStack implementation:

```bash
$ cat local.yaml 
service_offerings : {'m1.small' : '13954c5a-60f5-4ec8-9858-f45b12f4b846'}
templates : {'ami-1b814f72': '7fc2c704-a950-11e2-8b38-0b06fbda5106'}
```

>>>>>>> b7903d18de55f2b2906ed4e2ec287c889bfa8b39

```bash
$ cloudmonkey
☁ Apache CloudStack 🐵 cloudmonkey 4.1.0-snapshot3. Type help or ? to list commands.

> create sshkeypair name='Foo'
```


* Create a LAMP stack:

```bash
bin/stackmate MYSTACK01   --template-file=templates/LAMP_Single_Instance.template -p "DBName=cloud;DBUserName=cloud;SSHLocation=75.75.75.0/24;DBUsername=cloud;DBPassword=cloud;DBRootPassword=cloud;KeyName=Foo"
```

* If everything is successful, stackmate will hang after deploying the security groups and vms. 
You should see an output like this:

```bash
Your pre-signed URL is: http://localhost:4567/waitcondition/20130425-0706-kerujere-punopapa/WaitHandle
Try: curl -X PUT --data 'foo' http://localhost:4567/waitcondition/20130425-0706-kerujere-punopapa/WaitHandle
```
Executing the curl should unblock the wait handle. The idea of course is that the instance boots up, and reads its userdata and calls the same URL.

If you don't want the wait condition server to run, just use '-n'. Stackmate will not hang with this flag.

If you want to validate your template, you can use the --dry-run option. This will parse and validate the template and create an execution schedule.

## TODO
* Parallelize (with ruote concurrence) where possible
* rollback on error
* timeouts
* embed in a web app ( [Stacktician](https://github.com/chiradeep/stacktician) )
* add support for Advanced Zone templates (VPC), LB, etc
